# SRAE-WOW
Version 7.1.5.02 Alpha

Some Rich Asshole Extended for WOW is an addon for World of Warcraft which replaces the name of the 45th US President to one of several colorful phrases. The addon is inspired by browser addons for Firefox and Chrome which have the same name. 

The purpose of this addon is to alleviate players on World of Warcraft from political related trolling in public chat channels by changing names to something mildly humorus instead. 

To install this addon, simply download the Zip file, open it, drag the folders to your wow folder->interface->addons and it will just work. If you find instances of use not predicted by this addon, feel free to let me know and I can always add more swaps. 

This is an Alpha. 
If you are updating from the initial release, know you will have to delete the old folder and drop in the new one. Hopefully we can get this addon on curse so future updates just require a click of a button for you.
