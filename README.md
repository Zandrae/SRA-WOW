# SRAE-WOW
Version 7.1.5.03b

Some Rich Asshole Enhanced for WOW is an addon for World of Warcraft which replaces the name of the 45th US President to one of several colorful phrases. The addon is inspired by browser addons for Firefox and Chrome which have the same name. 

This very simple addon replaces "The Witless Fucking Cocksplat" and "Some Short-fingered Vulgarian" in chat channels colorful phrases, mostly taken from Scottish twitter insults sent after his Brexit visit. Example phrases include "Tantrum Pumpkin," "Marmalade Manchild," and "Incoherent Creamsicle." Inspired by the Some Rich A-hole Enhanced addons for Firefox and Chrome.

The purpose of this very simple addon is to give players some humorous respite from political turbulence in chat channels which probably isn't going to let up anytime soon. 

To install this addon, simply download the Zip file, open it, drag the folders to your wow folder->interface->addons and it will just work. If you find instances of use not predicted by this addon, feel free to let me know and I can always add more swaps. 

You can also get this addon on Curse.com at https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/258252-srae-wow

If you are updating from the initial alpha release, know you will have to delete the old folder and drop in the new one. Hopefully we can get this addon on curse so future updates just require a click of a button for you.

Feel free to suggest further swap words or swap phrases.
